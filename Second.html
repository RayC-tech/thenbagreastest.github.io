  <!-- Section 1: Curry Beats Boston -->
  <h2>Curry Beats Boston</h2>

  <div class="description">
    The 2022 NBA Finals was a defining chapter in Steph Curry's legendary career. Facing off against the Boston Celtics, Curry delivered a masterclass in leadership, skill, and determination, earning his first Finals MVP award. This defined Curry as a clutch performer and leader in the playoffs. He was constantly criticized for having great teams and below-average performances in previous playoffs, but this appearance locked Curry as a top 10 player in history.

  <h2>The Greatest Shooter in NBA History</h2>

  <div class="description">
    Steph Curry has completely transformed the game of basketball and is undeniably a top 10 player. Starting as an injury-prone player to a 2-time MVP with 4 rings. He’s considered the “Greatest Shooter known to man.” If Curry shoots, it’s probably going in. He’s also redefining how point guards play, where hitting a 3 is now required to stay in the lead.

  <!-- Section 3: Greatest Shot -->
  <h2>The Greatest Shot in NBA History</h2>
  <img src="images/mj-game-6.png" alt="Jordan 1997 Finals" class="main-image">
  <div class="description">
    The 1997 NBA Finals was a classic. Led by Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, the Bulls battled Karl Malone and John Stockton. Game 5, famously known as the “Flu Game,” saw Jordan deliver a 38-point performance while visibly ill, leading his team to victory. In my opinion, this was the greatest shot in NBA history.

  <h2>The Greatest Winner in NBA History</h2>

  <div class="description">
    Michael Jordan is widely regarded as the greatest player ever. His nearly perfect finals record (6–0) set a new standard. Aspiring players now strive not just for titles, but for undefeated records in the finals — a new expectation largely shaped by Jordan’s dominance.

  <!-- Section 5: Greatest Finals -->
  <h2>The Greatest Finals in NBA History</h2>
  <img src="images/lbj_160619_0.webp" alt="2016 Finals" class="main-image">
  <div class="description">
    The 2016 Finals were iconic. The 73–9 Warriors, pre-KD, were considered unbeatable. Down 3–1, LeBron James led the Cavaliers to an unbelievable comeback. This was more than a win — it defined LeBron’s greatness by defeating the best regular-season team in NBA history.

  <h2>The Greatest Player in NBA History</h2>
  <img src="images/180701213413-lebron-james-game-7-052718.jpg" alt="LeBron James" class="main-image">
  <div class="description">
    LeBron James is one of the most dominant and influential players ever. For me, he’s the greatest — not just because of stats, but because of his longevity and consistency. Averaging 27/7/7 for 20 years without major injury is just as impressive as Jordan’s perfect Finals record.
